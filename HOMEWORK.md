# Homework 10 - Building A Rails API using TDD

## Due Date

Wednesday, November 28, 2018 @ 2:00 PM

## Goals

- The purpose of this homework is to build an API using TDD to support the
  following set of functionality:

  - creating player

  - updating player

  - showing player

  - list players

  - deleting player

## API Reference

- request

GET /api/players

- response

```json
[ { id: 26,
first_name: "Nora",
last_name: "Renner",
email: "durward@labadie.org",
age: 22,
position: "defensive midfielder"
},
....
]

or

{ success: false }

- format

JSON

Note: For each player instance, you only need to include id, first_name,
last_name, email, age, position

- request

  POST /api/players

- response

{ id: ..., first_name: ..., last_name: ..., email: ..., age: ..., success: true }

or

{ success: false }

- format

JSON

- request

GET /api/players/:id

- response

  { id: ..., first_name: ..., last_name: ..., email: ..., age: ..., success: true }

  or

  { success: false }

- format

JSON

- request

DELETE /api/players/:id

- response:

{ success: true }

or

{ success: false }

- format

JSON

- request

PUT /api/players/:id

- response

{ success: true }

or

{ success: false }

## Player Model

- first_name - string

- last_name - string

- email - string

- age - integer

- position - string

  possible options for position

  - forward

  - right back

  - right midfielder

  - defensive midfielder

  - goalkeeper

  - striker

  - left midfielder

  - defensive midfielder

  - left back

  - stopper

  - sweeper

## Creating Rails API application

$cd fh-homework-10$ git init
$git add .$ git commit -am 'Initial commit'
\$ git checkout -b part-01-initial-api

Note: The solution for this homework should exist within the branch,
`part-01-initial-api`.

## Using TDD

You will be using RSpec request specs to test your API and your files for the
spec and implementation will reside in the following folders:

- spec folder

```

spec/requests/api/players_controller_spec.rb

```-

```

- implementation folder

  ```
  app/controllers/api/players_controller.rb
  ```

- running all specs

  ```
  $ rspec
  ```

  Note: Do not type `$` in the above. Just the command that follows.

  You are done when the above command generates the similar output:

  ```
  .................

  Finished in 0.23141 seconds (files took 0.77058 seconds to load)
  17 examples, 0 failures
  ```

- running a specific spec

  ```
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:16 # API::PlayersController GET /players retrieves all the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:28 # API::PlayersController GET /players/:id with valid params retrieves the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:37 # API::PlayersController GET /players/:id with valid params properly sets the success key
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:49 # API::PlayersController GET /players/:id with invalid params retrieves the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:58 # API::PlayersController GET /players/:id with invalid params retrieves the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:72 # API::PlayersController POST /players with valid params creates a new Player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:82 # API::PlayersController POST /players with valid params properly sets the success key
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:95 # API::PlayersController POST /players with invalid params creates a new player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:105 # API::PlayersController POST /players with invalid params properly sets the success key
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:124 # API::PlayersController PUT /players/:id with valid params updates the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:134 # API::PlayersController PUT /players/:id with valid params properly sets the success key
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:147 # API::PlayersController PUT /players/:id with invalid params updates the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:157 # API::PlayersController PUT /players/:id with invalid params properly sets the success key
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:172 # API::PlayersController DELETE /players/:id with valid params destroys the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:183 # API::PlayersController DELETE /players/:id with valid params properly sets success key
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:197 # API::PlayersController DELETE /players/:id with invalid params destroys the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:208 # API::PlayersController DELETE /players/:id with invalid params properly sets success key
  ```

## Generate Fake Data

- Use a Ruby gem called `faker` to generate 50 players

  - add the logic to your `seeds.rb` file for creating the player models

## Deliverables

- create Github repository called `fh-homework-10`

  Note: Follow the instructions for connecting your local repository to the Github repository.

- push changes to Github

  ```
  $ cd fh-homework-10
    $ git checkout part-01-initial-api
    $ git push
  ```

- merge changes into the master branch and push to Github

  ```
  $ cd fh-homework-10
  $ git checkout master
  $ git merge part-01-initial-api
  $ git push
  ```
